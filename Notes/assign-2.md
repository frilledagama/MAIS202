## Bag of words Model

The bag-of-words model is a simplifying representation used in natural language processing and information retrieval (IR). In this model, a text (such as a sentence or a document) is represented as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity.


Stemming: fast, simple, useful for information retrieval
->dog and dogmatic

stop words

Lemmatization:
-> text mining

Dont use both since they're both techniques for normalizing the data. 
For future NLP problems should I try both and compare results or are there specific types of problems that beneit more from Stemming than Lemmatization or vice-versa


Preventing Over/understemming

Porter Stemmer kinda not great as it often collapses sentiment distinctions
